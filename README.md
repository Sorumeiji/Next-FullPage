# Getting Started

You'll need a set of credentials for our [Contentful](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/dtb5w0ega2aw/home) account.

Create a file at `./.env.local` with your personal credentials. An example:

```dotenv
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_KEY=l-C5F3_*****
```

First, run the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
